## Amino acids and peptides

- Peptides consist of 20 amino acids 
- Amino acids are encoded by letters

## What are antimicrobial peptides?

- Short peptides, usually consisting of 5-100 amino acids
- Host defense peptides widespread in all living organisms
- Rich in positively charged and hydrophobic residues
- Able to interact with negatively charged bacterial membranes
- May display antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, anticancer properties

## Prediction of antimicrobial peptides with AmpGram

## Positive dataset - AMPs

- 12,389 AMPs from dbAMP database
- removal of sequences containing nonstandard amino acids (B, J, O, U, X, Z)
- homology reduction with CD-HIT (0.9 identity cut-off)
- final dataset: 2463 peptides


## Negative dataset construction

544,249 sequences from UniProt (experimentally validated, without antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal activity, and not possesing mitochondrial or plastid transit peptide)

## Train-test and benchmark datasets
 
- Both positive and negative dataset were divided into five equally sized groups of sequence lengths: 11–19, (ii) 20–26, (iii) 27–36, (iv) 37–60 and (v) 61–710. 
- One tenth of sequences from each group were extracetd to create the benchmark dataset (247 AMP and 247 non-AMPs).
- Remaining 2216 sequences in each dataset were used for training and testing.


## Extraction of n-grams

- All 10-mers from the positive dataset were considered as AMPs, whereas all 10-mers from the negative dataset as non-AMPs.
- 87,716 AMP 10-mers and 87,599 non-AMP 10-mers
- Extraction of n-grams: unigrams, bigrams (with a gap length from 1 to 3) and trigrams (single gap between the first and the second or the second and the third position)
- the counts of n-grams were binarized, where 1 means that an n-gram was present in the sequence and 0 if it was absent
